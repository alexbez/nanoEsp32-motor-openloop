# nanoEsp32-motor-openloop

Sketch for Arduino Nano ESP32 to control two DC motors via TB_6612 motor controller in the open loop.
It always does the DC motors speed measurement, but not published these results yet.
As a next step, the PID regulator would be added to both motors to precisely control their rotation speeds.
